# React Native: Accessing Uninitialized State Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected code.

## Problem

The problem arises when you try to access state data in the component's render method, useEffect hook or other sections of the code before the asynchronous operation that fetches the data has completed.  This leads to undefined or null values, causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves using conditional rendering or nullish coalescing (`??`) operators to handle cases where the state is still null or undefined.  Only rendering relevant content after the state variable is populated helps to prevent errors.
