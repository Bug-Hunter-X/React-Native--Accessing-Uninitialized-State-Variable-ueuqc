This error occurs when you try to access a state variable in a component before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when using asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API) within the component's render method or when using a state variable before it's declared in the component's state. For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect: Trying to use 'data' before it's fetched
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('someApiEndpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* This will cause an error if data is null or undefined */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
